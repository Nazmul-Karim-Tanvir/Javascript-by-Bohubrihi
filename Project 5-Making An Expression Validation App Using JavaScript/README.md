## Overview Expression Validation App
This is a responsive web application that allows you to validate email,phone and postal code using regular expression.I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,JavaScript, DOM and Regular Expression to create a user friendly interface.

## Challenge
You will make an app which will validate an expression whether it is correct or not.

The user will see a menu where the expression he wants to validate will be given - Email, Phone Number, Post Code, etc. You can add more options if you want

An input field to select the user option will be shown (prompt function), which will match the regular expression of that option, such as /^\d{4}$/ for Post Code. 

You can create regular expressions yourself or copy them from the internet.

You can also use forms to take user input.

You can switch regular expressions by writing a switch condition

After checking with regular expression it will show whether it is valid or invalid.  

Put your code in the submission (link to drive or github) to verify that you have used the regular expression.

## Features
- You can add a new product by clicking add to cart button.
- product will show in Shopping Cart.  
- You can remove a product from  clicking the Remove button next to it.
- The Shopping Cart items are saved in the local storage of the browser, so they will persist even if you close or refresh the page.
- product will show in Shopping Cart saction which is located below items and clicking View Shopping Cart will move page to Shopping Cart saction  

## Built With

- HTML5 
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Document Object Model (DOM)
- Regular Expression 

## My Procedure
To create this web application, I followed these steps:

- I created an HTML file named index.html that displays a web page with four products: a camera, earphones, a laptop, and a computer. Each product has an image, a name, a description, and a price. The user can add any product to their shopping cart by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button. The shopping cart is shown at the bottom of the page with a list of the selected products. The code uses Bootstrap classes to style the elements and JavaScript to handle the events.

- In my Script.js file I used different DOM and functions for creating, removing and storing items by using DOM manipulation methods, local storage methods, conditional statements, loops, and array methods.

- I tested the web application by opening it in a web browser and performing some actions such as adding, deleting items and refreshing page.
